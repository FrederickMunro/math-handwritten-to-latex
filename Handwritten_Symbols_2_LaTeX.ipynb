        "The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model for image classification, specifically for identifying handwritten mathematical formulas from images and converting them into LaTeX readable code. Prior to training the model, image data was preprocessed, notably by converting PNG files to grayscale tensors and loading them into a dataset. The project utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an encoder-decoder architecture for feature extraction and image reconstruction, as well as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells for sequence modeling and capturing long-term dependencies in the data. However, due to various issues encountered during training, the model was not able to read entire expressions in time. As a result, the model discussed in this report is currently limited to reading individual mathematical symbols."

These are XML-based files used for representing digital ink data with time-series information, including metadata such as pen pressure, pen tilt, pen velocity, pen color, and stroke labels. To prepare the data for training, the INKML files were first converted to PNG format using code obtained from Harold Mouchère, as provided in the dataset. The PNG images of the handwritten mathematical symbols were then converted to grayscale tensors to reduce computational complexity and normalize pixel values. These preprocessing steps helped in preparing the dataset for training a machine learning model on the handwritten mathematical symbols data.\n",

        "Based on the experiments conducted, several conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, training the model with more epochs did not necessarily lead to improved performance on the test set. This suggests that the model may have reached a saturation point in terms of learning from the available data. Moreover, The drastic difference in symbol distributions between the training and test sets, such as the presence of LaTeX symbols in the test set that were rarely present in the training set, may have contributed to the lower performance of the model on the test set. This highlights the importance of ensuring a balanced distribution of data between the training and test sets to avoid such discrepancies. Finally, The results achieved in this project were not as favorable as those reported in related works. This suggests that there may be further opportunities to improve the model's performance through adjustments to the training data, model architecture, or hyperparameters.\n",

        "In conclusion, while the experiments provided insights into the performance of the model, it is important to consider the limitations and potential areas for improvement. This includes the need for a balanced distribution of data, further optimization of the model, and comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of the results obtained."
